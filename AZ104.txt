Update domain - Azure applies updates to the physical infrastructure one update domain at a time.
Fault domain - virtual machines in the fault domain share a common power source and network switch.

Virtual Machine Scale Set
=========================

Is a group of virtual machines. The number of VMs can increase or decrease based on demand

Vertical scaling - adding mem, storage, etc
Horizontal - multiple machines hosting an application.

* sudo stress --cpu 1000 (adds artificial stress/load on machine)

Cool down time - time it takes an app to start up on second VM and propagate to the other VM (Stabilize)
Flexible orchestration - manually setup the scaling

Virtual machine images
======================

Its possible to create an image(containing OS and data disks) which can then be used over and over. This is stored as part of the
Azure compute gallery and can be shared with other users.
2 type of images
Specialized images - retains infor about specific users and machine infor.
Generalized images - infor about specific users and machine is removed.
Image is create only after OS and applications are installed.
Use the capture button in the VM overview page.
VMs can now be created from the image under (All resource > webimage gallery).

Proximity placement groups
==========================
Placing VMs in the same scale set closer for low latency.
First create the resource proximity placement group and then when creating a VM under Advanced, choose the proximity group
*Note Proximity placement is per region i.e if group created in East Europe, then VM can only be added to that one.

Azure Web Apps
==============

When you dont want the burden of maintaining the server and running web applications, Azure has Azure Web App service which has support for .NET
, NET Core, Java, Ruby,Node.js, PHP, Python etc. The service is able to scale up or down based on demand.
This is done by creating an App Service Plan. 
The plan defines the set of compute resources to assign to the Wep App.
-Search for Web App service in Azure to create. FQDN Name will be xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net , xxxxx being custom.
-Choose runtime stack e.g .NET6, ASP.NET etc
-Choose plan accordingly. Windows plan name is created by default but you create your own
-2 Services are created. App Service and App Service Plan.
-Go to access web app on browser > xxxxx.azurewebsites.net
-Download and install visual studio for windows, create and publish project to azure app service from PC
  -Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
  -Click on the Free download of the community edition
-You can create multiple web apps on the same service plan
-Azure web app has 2 types of logging features.
 Application logging - captures log mesgs generated by the application code
 Webserver logging - records raw HTTP request data
-These are accessed via web app under App service logs
-Log stream tab shows realtime logs.
